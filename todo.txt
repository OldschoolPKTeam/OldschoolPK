todo
fix package directive does not match file location
make plugin data load from each module (as resource probably to make it easier to load)
test distZip

improvements
check the difference between implementation and api because i had to `api(project(":game:plugins:dump"))`

last
check dependencies to make sure there's nothing that's not needed

opensource
mirror everything except the plugins to a self hosted repository

readme todo

how to add plugins
- modules names have to be unique to itself, can't share names with other modules
- your module's packaging should have a relation with it's location in the /plugins/ directory.
- resources
how to add extensions
- files in the api.ext package cannot have the same name or they will have inconsistent behaviour
- they should always be name module-name_ClassNameExt.kt
- here's the issue https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-23366

think about
how to add new modules later for the open source version
